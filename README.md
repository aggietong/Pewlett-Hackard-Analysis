# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Challenge #7 (UTOR-VIRT-DATA-PT-12-2021-U-B)
# Student: Agnes Tong

## Overview of the Analysis

There are two main objectives for this analysis: 
  1.	Determine the number of retiring employees by title
  2.	Determine the employees eligible for the mentorship program

This information will allow Pewlett Hackward to strategize on how to prepare for the “silver tsunami” retiring by initiating a mentorship program. 

## Results

#### Number of Retiring Employees by Title

There are 57,668 employees with senior titles, who are of retirement age. This represents 64% of the current Pewlett-Hackard workforce. Almost 1/3 are Senior Engineers, and another 1/3 are Senior staff.

#### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program 

Of those that are retiring, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program. Reference the mentorship eligibility csv file in the Data folder for the full list of staff with mentorship eligibility. 



## Summary

The immediate priority groups are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, as they make up 2/3 of the silver tsunami. The company should proactively look at people who were born beyond 1952 and 1955 to understand the number of retirees and potential mentors for years to come. Looking at current projections, there are not enough retirees to mentor the next generation. The company can use the retiree data for future years to start succession planning.
